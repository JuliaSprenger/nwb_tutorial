# nwb_tutorial: NWB tutorials made for Cosyne 2020

Use `NWB_tutorial_2020.ipynb` to following along with **Part 2** of the tutorial.

**Part 3** will include a demonstration of the NWBWidgets project. 
We have included two small NWB files recently released by the Svoboda Lab.
These files have been placed in  `/opt/data/Cosyne2020_NWB_tutorial/`. 
You can load these files yourself and explore them with the `nwbwidgets.ipynb` notebook.

Thank you to the DANDI team for hosting these tutorials on the DANDI Hub.
DANDI is a new platform for sharing neurophysiology data, and is building 
search and visualization features for NWB files.
