# nwb_tutorial: NWB tutorials made for Cosyne 2020

Use `NWB_tutorial_2020.ipynb` to following along with **Part 2** of the tutorial.

**Part 3** will include a demonstration of the NWBWidgets project. 
We have included two small NWB files recently released by the Svoboda Lab.
These files have been placed in  `/opt/data/Cosyne2020_NWB_tutorial/`. 
You can load these files yourself and explore them with the `nwbwidgets.ipynb` notebook.

Thank you to the DANDI team for hosting these tutorials on the dandihub.
DANDI is a new platform for sharing neurophysiology data. Learn more about the project
[here](www.dandiarchive.org). This Jupyter Hub instace will be shut down shortly after 
the tutorial (so make sure to save anything you want to keep locally). You will be able 
to do similar things with dandihub once it launches.
